# bank_loan_analysis_project

For this comprehensive Bank Loan Analysis project, I utilized a mix of Tableau, Excel, Power BI, and SQL to deliver insightful and actionable data visuals.

1. Data Preparation (SQL & Excel)
We started by gathering and cleaning the raw data using SQL. This involved:

**Importing Data:** Collected loan application and repayment data from various sources into our database.
**Data Cleaning:** Used SQL queries to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize data formats.
**Data Aggregation:** Aggregated data to derive meaningful metrics such as total loans, repayment rates, default rates, and customer demographics.

**Excel played a crucial role in the initial data analysis:**

**Data Validation:** Ensured data accuracy and consistency.

**Basic Analysis:** Conducted preliminary analysis to identify key patterns and trends.

**Data Visualization (Power BI & Tableau)**
Then moved to the visualization phase using Power BI and Tableau:

**Power BI:**
Loan Portfolio Dashboard: Created interactive dashboards to track loan applications, disbursements, and repayments.
Risk Management: Visualized risk metrics to monitor and manage high-risk loans.
Customer Insights: Segment customers based on demographic data for targeted marketing.

**Tableau:**

Geographical Analysis: Used maps to display loan distribution and repayment trends across different regions.
Trend Analysis: Illustrated loan performance over time, highlighting seasonal patterns and campaign impacts.
Advanced Visuals: Designed custom visuals like donut charts and heatmaps to enhance data interpretation.

By integrating SQL for data management, Excel for preliminary analysis, and Power BI & Tableau for advanced visualization, I created a robust tool that provides a holistic view of the bank's loan portfolio. This approach enables data-driven decision-making, risk assessment, and strategic planning, ultimately driving the bank's growth and stability.
